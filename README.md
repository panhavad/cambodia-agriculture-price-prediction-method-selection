**RBF Method for Price Prediction**

This project will accept any excel sheet with one feature for prediction.
Basically first this you have to run the method comparison first to see which of the 3 method is feed best for your data. In this case the RBF fit best that why git name RBF haha.



For method comparison it will take a bit longer since there are 3 method load all together at once

 As you see in this case the RBF fit the most to our dataset, but not perfectly fit so the predicted data not that much accurate. 

Currently it run from excel which the dataset I get from https://amis.org.kh/en, the agriculture government website of Cambodia. As of this note create, to be honest their data format seen like JSON but wrong syntax so many place ðŸ˜ªðŸ˜ª wrong in the place that it not suppose to be wrong.

And finally the program able to predict the price for next session like this, but this is not 100% complete yet. It will be improve soon.
